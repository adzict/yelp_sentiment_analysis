# Yelp Dataset Exploration and Sentiment Analysis

The Yelp dataset is a collection of businesses, reviews, and user data, intended for learning purposes, published by Yelp. It contains over 8 million reviews for 200 thousand businesses in 10 metropolitan areas of the US. The dataset that will be used for the purposes of sentiment analysis and prediction will contain businesses from the Phoenix, AZ metropolitan area.

We will explore the dataset to gain valuable insights of businesses working in this area, and then proceed to perform sentiment analysis of the reviews, and make actionable recommendations to businesses that will help them understand customer needs, and monitor customer feedback. Out last step will include predicting the sentiment of a Yelp review.Â 

A very important step is asking questions we need to give answers to. As part of my mentorship I was tasked to answer the following:

* Gain different insights by exploring the dataset
* What businesses are getting top reviews?
* Which categories of businesses are getting top reviews?
* How often do businesses get reviewed over time?
* How do the categories of trending and top reviewed businesses differ?
* Which business categories get bad reviews?
* What are the most common words in bad reviews?
* Are reviews influenced by a user's friends?
* Build a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of Yelp reviews.
* Predict or recommend something else.
